    // In a real scenario, you would:
    // 1. Gather all necessary data:
    //    - Courses, Sections (and their requirements like lab type, duration)
    //    - Labs (and their capacities, available times, types)
    //    - Faculty (and their availability, course assignments)
    //    - Existing bookings (to avoid conflicts or to schedule around)
    //    - Constraints (e.g., no back-to-back labs for a section, specific lab preferences)
    //

    // const [courses] = await pool.query('SELECT * FROM Courses');
    // const [sections] = await pool.query('SELECT * FROM Sections');
    // const [labs] = await pool.query('SELECT * FROM Labs WHERE is_available = true');

    //    const generatedSchedule = await runSchedulingAlgorithm({ courses, sections, labs, ... });

    //    - Store the generated bookings in the Bookings table.
    //    - Handle any conflicts or unschedulable items.
